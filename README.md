# 📚 E-Learning Platform

**E-learning** is a web-based platform built for a science fair competition. This platform allows students to access lessons, courses, and educational materials. It serves as a functional **Learning Management System (LMS)** prototype developed entirely using front-end technologies.

## ⭐ Overview

* **Project Type**: Front-End Web Application
* **Purpose**: To build a simple LMS prototype, practice web development, and create a foundational e-learning platform that can be extended in the future.
* **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

> **Note**: This is a static front-end prototype, without any backend or database integrations at this stage.

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

* **LMS Prototype**: Create a basic, functional Learning Management System that allows users to browse and interact with courses.
* **Web Development**: Learn and practice front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
* **Extendable Design**: Build a simple, scalable project for potential future features and upgrades.

## 📦 Tech Stack

This project uses:

* **HTML** — Structuring the page and content.
* **CSS** — Styling and layout of the website.
* **JavaScript** — Handling the dynamic interactions and behaviors.

> *(This project currently does not include any back-end services or databases.)*

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vision-Science-Fair/E-learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd E-learning/LeanNest
   ```

3. **Open the `home.html` file** in your browser.

4. *(Optional)* If you prefer using a local server, you can use a tool like **VS Code Live Server** or run a local server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```

> 💡 **Note**: Since this project is static, no build or server setup is required.

## 🌐 Deployed Version

## 🧰 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
E-learning/
└──
    ├── index.html          # Main entry page
    ├── styles/             # Folder containing all CSS files
    ├── scripts/            # JavaScript files for interactivity
    └── assets/             # Images, icons, fonts, etc.
```

## ✅ Current Status

* ✔️ **Static Front-End**: The front-end is functional and allows users to access content.
* ❌ **No Backend**: There is no server or database integration.
* ❌ **No Login System**: User authentication (login/signup) and roles (student/teacher/admin) are not implemented.
* ❌ **Manual Course Content**: Courses and content need to be manually added.

> This project is a **front-end prototype** and does not yet include dynamic features like user management or content creation.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

There are several features planned for future updates:

1. **Backend Integration**:

   * Use **Node.js + Express** to build the backend.
   * Integrate a database like **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for storing user data, courses, and progress.

2. **User Authentication**:

   * Implement login/signup functionality and manage different user roles (e.g., student, teacher, admin).

3. **Course Management**:

   * Add an admin interface to create, update, and manage courses.
   * Allow students to enroll in courses and track their progress.

4. **Quizzes and Assignments**:

   * Add features like quizzes, assignments, and interactive learning activities.

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**:

   * Improve the user interface and make the design more visually appealing.
   * Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

6. **Framework Migration**:

   * If the project grows, consider migrating to a modern JavaScript framework like **React** or **Vue.js** for better scalability and maintainability.

7. **Real-Time Features**:

   * Implement real-time collaboration features like live chat or group discussions.
