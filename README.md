# 📚 E-Learning Platform

> A simple front-end e-learning application developed for a science fair competition.

## ⭐ Overview

**E-learning** is a web-based platform created as part of a science fair project. It provides a structured space for students to access lessons, courses, and learning materials — built entirely with standard web technologies.

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

* Build a functional **learning-management system (LMS)** prototype.
* Practice and explore web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
* Create a simple and extendable front-end project for future upgrades.

## 📦 Tech Stack

This project uses:

* **HTML** — page structure
* **CSS** — layout and styling
* **JavaScript** — front-end behavior and interactivity

> *(No backend or database is included at this stage.)*

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vision-Science-Fair/E-learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd E-learning/LeanNest
   ```

3. **Open the main HTML file** (usually `index.html`) in your browser.

4. *(Optional)* Serve via a local static server such as VS Code Live Server or:

   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```

> 💡 The project is fully static — no build steps required.

## 🧰 Project Structure

```
E-learning/
└── LeanNest/
    ├── index.html          # main HTML entry page
    ├── styles/             # CSS files
    ├── scripts/            # JavaScript files
    └── assets/             # images, icons, fonts, etc.
```

## ✅ Current Status

* ✔️ Static front-end is functional
* ❌ No backend or database
* ❌ No login system or user roles
* ❌ Course content must be added manually (static)

This makes the project a **front-end prototype**, not a full LMS.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

Potential upgrades for later development:

* Backend (Node.js + Express) + database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
* User authentication (login/signup) and roles (student/teacher/admin)
* Course creation/upload interface
* Enrollment and progress tracking
* Quizzes, assignments, and interactive activities
* Improved UI/UX and responsive layout
* More modular JavaScript or migration to a framework (React, Vue, etc.)
